# twitter_text_classification_nlp

## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on society, and the need for accurate and
reliable information has never been greater. In this project, we propose to use natural language
processing (NLP) techniques to classify text data related to COVID-19.
Specifically, we will use the dataset from this Kaggle link,

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification

which includes thousands of text snippets from various sources such as news articles, social
media posts, and government documents.
## Goal
The objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify text data into
different categories related to COVID-19, such as information about symptoms, treatments, and
vaccines. The model will be trained on the dataset mentioned above and will be evaluated
based on its ability to classify unseen text data.
## Methodology
The first step in this project will be to preprocess the text data, which will involve cleaning and
normalizing the text, as well as removing any irrelevant information. Next, we will use various
NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization to prepare the text data for
modeling. We will then use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, naive
Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM to train the model.
## Evaluation
The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1 score.
